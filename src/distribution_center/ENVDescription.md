We want to create simulation for a simple distribution center where:
* Pallets arrive every N seconds from the factory and accumulate in a staging space that can contain N number of pallets.
* Trailers arrive every N minutes and must park at one of N doors.
* N workers take pallets from the staging space and put them on trailers. When a trailer reaches N pallets, it is full and can leave immediately.
